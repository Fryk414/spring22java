# Project - modeling a database

## Brainstorming

Brainstorm ideas of companies to create a database for (15 minutes). Try to find examples of tables and fields that can be included. 

We meet and share our ideas.

## Execute 

Search for
- People
- Things
- Locations
- Events

Create a ER-diagram with:
- Multiple **one-to-many** relationships
- Multiple **many-to-many** relationships

The ER-diagram must contain at least 8 entities.

Model the database from the ER-diagram. 

Take a screenshot of the model **every hour** (to get the history)

## Deliver

Deliver your project to another group:
- Screenshot on the lastest ER-diagram and database-diagram (with field types visible)

## Criticism 

Look at the ER-diagram 

Try to find as many shortcomings as possible with the other groups solution:
- Incorrect tables/entities
- Wrong relationships
- Unclear naming of tables/entities, fields
- Unclear data types
- Give suggestions on how the database model can be expanded

## Update 

Update your model based on the other project group feedback.

## Presentation 

Present your work in 5 minutes:
- Why did you choose this model?
- Explain the process
    * The development of the ER-diagram
    * The development of the database diagram
- Explain the end result (ER-diagram + database diagram)
- Show some detail of the solution that you find interesting
- What benefit did you have from the criticism?
- What have you learned?
- What was challenging? 
- If you continued, what would you do then?
